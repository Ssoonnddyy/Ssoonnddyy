* **TopBar**: Contains navigation links for easy access to different sections of the store.
* **Filters**: Allows users to filter products based on various criteria.
* **Product List**: Displays the list of products available for purchase.

## Components

The following components are utilized within the `Home` component:

* **Container**: A layout component that provides consistent spacing and alignment for child elements.
* **Title**: Renders a heading with customizable text and size.
* **TopBar**: A navigation bar that provides links to different sections of the application.
* **Filters**: A component that allows users to filter products based on selected criteria.
